In this tutorial, we would be learning on how to display number of post views WordPress using a WordPress plugin.

Tracking the views of your post and see them growing can be a satisfaction for the writer. This is why we are going to use a WordPress plugin to show the unique view count in the front-end.

It will also include an option to sort your posts based on the view count.

## Step 1: Install the Posts Unique View Counter.
Login to your WordPress admin.

Hover to **Plugins** in the sidebar menu then click **Add New**.

On the search box that can be found in the upper right corner of the screen type the keyword **Posts Unique View Counter** or **David Angulo**.

## Step 3: View your WordPress post list.
All view count will start at nothing. You can view the posts list by hovering to **Posts** in the sidebar menu then click **All Posts**.

You can see an additional column entitled **Views** that is sortable.

The count will start once a user views your post.

## Step 4: View one of your post.

You can also view one of your posts and see just before the content the current view count of your post.

Thatâ€™s it. This plugin only counts the unique view meaning a person that viewed the same post twice will only be counted as one.
