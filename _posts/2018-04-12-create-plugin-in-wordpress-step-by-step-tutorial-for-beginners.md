This tutorial will guide you on how to create plugin in WordPress.

WordPress plugins are simply PHP scripts that extend the functionality of your WordPress website. If you have a running WordPress website and you need to add some functionality you can always rely on the wordpress plugin directory, this enables you to add functionality to your website without the need to learn on how to code.

But, what if the functionality that you are looking for is not available? If you are a developer, then you need to write the code yourself and if you are generous enough you will make the plugin flexible, meaning it can be installed and it is compatible with all WordPress websites. If you are non-developer then you might need to hire a developer to do it for you or instead search for an alternative plugin that suits your needs.

## Step 1: Create a folder.
You will need to create a folder with the folder name as your plugin name. Then put this folder in the `wp-content/plugins` directory.

In this tutorial, we will name the folder as `mysuperbplugin`.

## Step 2: Create a PHP file.
The PHP file must be inside the folder that you have created and for this tutorial, we will name it as `mysuperbplugin.php`.

The content of `mysuperbplugin.php` is as follows:

```php
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: My Superb Plugin
Plugin URI: https://www.davidangulo.xyz/portfolio/
Description: A very superb plugin.
Version: 1.0.0
Author: David Angulo
Author URI: https://www.davidangulo.xyz/
License: GPL2
*/
```

The content above will be the description of your plugin. This is a standard format and you can add more information if you want.

If you navigate to your plugins, you should see **My Superb Plugin** in the list. You might want to activate your plugin now even though it does not have any function just yet.

## Step 3: Plan your plugin functionality.
Ask yourself, what should your plugin do? There are tons of plugins in the WordPress directory and if you are planning to include yours in that list you must create something unique.

Plugins can be a simple such as printing a text to complex such as having an e-commerce plugin or reservation plugin. Each plugin has their own functionalities.

I will just list some functionalities and example plugins that can guide you on how to create plugin in WordPress.
