This tutorial will guide you to find out what PHP version does your web hosting offer. Maybe you could also consider migrating from one web host to another if it does not meet your requirements.

## Why do you need to know your PHP version?
PHP 7 has been released for some time now but still, most of the website still uses PHP 5. Well, some website owners don’t care much about this as long as their website is running especially those who don’t have coding experience.

Majority of the websites still uses PHP 5, and many web hosting still doesn’t support PHP 7. PHP 7 is a lot faster than PHP 5, you might consider updating if ever you have a time.

You might want to follow this tutorial if you’re curious enough about what PHP version are they using on your website.

Also, you might also consider updating to PHP 7 or if your web hosting still does not support it, you may consider moving to another web hosting as PHP 5 support will officially end on 31st of December 2018 according to [php.net](https://php.net/supported-versions.php).
