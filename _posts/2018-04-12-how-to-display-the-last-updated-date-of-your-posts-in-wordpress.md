In this tutorial, we would be learning on how to display the last updated date of your posts on WordPress.

Showing the last updated date of a post can be very beneficial. This allows your users to know that your post is still valid today, meaning it is kept up-to-date.

Some posts really need to be updated especially when you are writing tutorials because it might work today and might not work tomorrow so you’ll have to keep it updated to make sure that the post doesn’t go to waste.

## Step 1: Install the Post Updated Date plugin.
Login to your WordPress admin then hover to **Plugins** in the sidebar menu and click **Add New**.

On the upper right there is a search box and type **Post Updated Date**. The plugin you are going to install must be authored by **Ataul Ghani**.
